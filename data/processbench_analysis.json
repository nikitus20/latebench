        "To find the smallest number \\( n \\), we start by considering the given equation: \\( x^2 + 7 = f_1(x)^2 + f_2(x)^2 + \\cdots + f_n(x)^2 \\). Notice that \\( x^2 + 7 \\) is always greater than or equal to 7 for any real value of \\( x \\). We also observe that the right-hand side of the equation is a sum of squares of polynomials with rational coefficients. This means each term on the right-hand side must be non-negative.",
        "Now consider the case when \\( x = 0 \\). Plugging in \\( x = 0 \\) into the equation, we get: \\( 0^2 + 7 = f_1(0)^2 + f_2(0)^2 + \\cdots + f_n(0)^2 \\). This simplifies to \\( 7 = f_1(0)^2 + f_2(0)^2 + \\cdots + f_n(0)^2 \\). Since 7 is a prime number, the only way to express it as a sum of squares of integers is \\( 1^2 + 2^2 \\) (since 7 cannot be expressed as a single square). However, we are looking for polynomials with rational coefficients. In this case, we can express 7 as a sum of squares of two rational numbers: \\( (\\sqrt{7})^2 = (\\sqrt{7})^2 + 0^2 \\), but this does not satisfy our requirement of having rational coefficients for the polynomials. We need at least two non-zero terms.",
        "After trying different combinations, we find that 7 can be expressed as a sum of squares of three rational numbers: \\( (2)^2 + (1)^2 + (\\sqrt{2})^2 \\neq 7 \\), however, \\( (2)^2 + (1)^2 + (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 7 \\). However, we used integer coefficients here. Now we try with a simple expression like \\( x^2 \\) and constants. We see: \\( x^2 + 7 = (x^2 + 2)^2 + (-1)^2 + (-1)^2 + (-1)^2 \\). Comparing both sides, we see we have satisfied our initial condition. So \\( n = 4 \\) satisfies the equation.",
