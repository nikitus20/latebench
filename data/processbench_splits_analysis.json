        "steps": [
          "To solve the problem of finding 4004 positive integers such that the sum of any 2003 of them is not divisible by 2003, we can proceed as follows: First, define the integers. Let the 4004 integers be \\(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{4004}\\). We need to ensure that for any subset of 2003 integers, their sum is not divisible by 2003.",
          "Second, consider the sum modulo 2003. For any subset of 2003 integers, say \\(a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \\ldots, a_{i_{2003}}\\), we need the sum \\(S = a_{i_1} + a_{i_2} + \\cdots + a_{i_{2003}}\\) to not be congruent to 0 modulo 2003. That is, \\(S \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{2003}\\).",
          "Third, use properties of modular arithmetic. Consider the sum of all 4004 integers, which we will denote as \\(T = a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_{4004}\\). If we take the sum of any 2003 integers, we can express it in terms of \\(T\\). Specifically, if we remove one integer from \\(T\\), the remaining sum of the other 2003 integers is \\(T - a_j\\) for some \\(j\\). Therefore, we need \\(T - a_j \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{2003}\\) for all \\(j\\), which implies \\(T \\not\\equiv a_j \\pmod{2003}\\) for all \\(j\\).",
          "Fourth, choose specific values for the integers. To satisfy the condition, we can choose the integers such that they are all congruent to 1 modulo 2003.

Then, the sum of any 2003 of these integers is \\(2003 \\cdot 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2003}\\), but since we are considering the sum modulo 2003, this is equivalent to 0 modulo 2003, which is not what we want. Instead, we should consider the sum of the integers modulo 2003. The sum of all 4004 integers is \\(4004 \\cdot 1 = 4004 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2003}\\) (since \\(4004 = 2003 \\cdot 2 + 1\\)).",
          "Now, if we take any 2003 of these integers, their sum is \\(2003 \\cdot 1 = 2003 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2003}\\) minus one integer, which is 1, so the sum is \\(2003 - 1 = 2002 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{2003}\\). Therefore, the integers \\(a_i = 2003k + 1\\) for \\(k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 3999\\) will work. The sum of any 2003 of these integers will be \\(2003 \\cdot 2003k + 2003 - 2003m = 2003^2k + 2003 - 2003m \\equiv 2003 - m \\pmod{2003}\\), where \\(m\\) is the number of times 1 is subtracted, and since \\(m \\neq 2003\\), the sum is not 0 modulo 2003.",
